# Sahay: AI-Powered Voice Journalling for Mental Wellness üå±

Sahay is a revolutionary, AI-powered mental wellness ecosystem designed as a proactive and confidential companion for Indian youth. Our prototype is not just an app; it's an agentic system built to address the dual challenges of mental stress and academic pressure through voice journalling.

## üåü What is Sahay?

At its core is a real-time, empathetic voice AI (powered by Google Gemini) that allows users to journal their thoughts and feelings in a judgment-free space, with a strict privacy-first guarantee (no audio is ever stored). This is orchestrated by a sophisticated multi-agent architecture built on Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Specialized agents for insight, safety, and memory collaborate through a central Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, allowing for deep, nuanced analysis.

The platform uniquely integrates this advanced wellness support with a suite of intelligent study tools to help users manage a primary source of their stress. Sahay is designed to be a culturally resonant, evidence-based first line of support, empowering a generation to build resilience.

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, WebSockets, NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch
- **AI**: Google Gemini Live API, Silero VAD
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, PyAudio

## üß† AI Approach

### CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) Integration
- Identifies unhelpful thought patterns
- Challenges limiting beliefs through gentle questioning
- Helps users understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors

### Socratic Questioning
- Uses open-ended questions to encourage deeper reflection
- Guides self-discovery about emotional and academic patterns
- Helps users explore their experiences more thoroughly

### Data Collection for Personalization
- **Wellness**: Daily routines, activity levels, social connections, emotional states
- **Study**: Study patterns, productivity levels, academic pressures, learning habits
- **Insights**: Sentiment analysis, behavioral patterns, stress indicators

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No Audio Storage**: All voice data is processed in real-time and never stored
- **Local Processing**: Voice activity detection runs locally on your device
- **Secure Communication**: All data transmission is encrypted
- **No Personal Data**: No personal information is collected or stored

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: Use headphones to prevent microphone from picking up Sahay's voice
2. **Connection Issues**: Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
3. **Audio Quality**: Check that your microphone permissions are enabled
4. **WebSocket Errors**: Restart the backend server if you encounter connection issues

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking the browser console for detailed audio processing information.
